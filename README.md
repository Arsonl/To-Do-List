# To-Do-List

Application developed using Flask framework:
-the user can create a list of tasks in 3 different locations depending on the urgency
-location 1 - CRITICAL - for tasks that need to be done as soon as possible: the user adds a task, a deadline and then a timer will be shown on the screen
-location 2 - To be done soon - for tasks that need to be done soon: the user adds a task and a deadline
-location 3 - Optionals - for tasks that can be done at any time: the user adds a task in the list.
-for all locations, the user can- edit the name and the deadline (where possible) of the task
                                - delete a task from the list 
                                - check a task from the list
